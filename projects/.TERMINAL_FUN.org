** Fun Terminal Programs
Run the following commands at a terminal prompt to install a couple of fun terminal programs.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt-get -y install nyancat cowsay
#+END_SRC
** Run ~cowsay~
Issue this command...

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cowsay "what do you call a cow with no legs?"
#+END_SRC

/Funny! Right?/

The cow didn't give us the punchline, so issue this command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cowsay -d "GROUND BEEF!"
#+END_SRC

ðŸ˜‚
** Run ~nyancat~

Once you start it, you'll have to type ~CTRL-c~ to get out of it. Issue the following command to Nyan till you just can't Nyan anymore.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nyancat
#+END_SRC
