1. Connect the LCD to your Pi (ask a coach for assistance with this step).
2. Open the ~lcd_hello.py~ file in IDLE (or Thonny). /NOTE: this should be under ~/home/pi/dev/examples/lcd-hello/~.
3. Run the module use ~F5~ in IDLE.

The script will prompt for user input in the Python shell.  Type the text you'd like to display and keep an eye on the LCD when you press ~Enter~.
