* Running this example
Hopefully, you've installed the example files using the ~make~ command as described in ~examples/README.org~.

1. Connect the ~RX~ (green) wire of the LCD to the ~UART TXD~ pin on your Pi (/Note: this is GPIO 14/).
2. Power the LCD:

   1. Connect the 5V (red) wire of the LCD to a 5V pin on your Pi.

   2. Connect the GND (black) wire of the LCD to a GND pin on your Pi.

3. Open the ~lcd_hello.py~ file in IDLE (or Thonny). /NOTE/: this should be under ~/home/pi/dev/examples/lcd-hello/~.
4. Run the module use ~F5~ in IDLE.

The script will prompt for user input in the Python shell.  Type the text you'd like to display and keep an eye on the LCD when you press ~Enter~.
* Next Steps
- View the documentation for our custom lcd module.  See ~/home/pi/dev/examples/lcd/lcd_doc.html~.
- What would /you/ change?  Make small changes to the script and test the results!
