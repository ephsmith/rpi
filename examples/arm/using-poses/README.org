** Save Poses in the GUI
You can save poses to a file using the GUI.
1. Select *File -> Save Poses* from the menubar.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to save the file
3. Enter the filename you want to save the poses to.

** Loading Poses into a Python Program
We need the ~json~ module to load the poses into our program.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import json
#+END_SRC

We can import the poses directly into a program variable. *You'll need the full path to the file*.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  with open('/home/pi/my_poses.json', 'r') as f:
      poses = json.load(f)
#+END_SRC

** Using Imported Poses

The poses are imported as a Python dictionary.  With this dictionary, we can access our poses using the names we assigned them in the GUI.  Access a pose with the name "max" in the following way:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
max_pose = poses['max']
#+END_SRC

~max_pose~ is now a dictionary containing all of the pose information.  We can move the arm to this position like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
arm.move(**max_pose)
#+END_SRC
